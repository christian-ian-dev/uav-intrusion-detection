End-to-end statistical analysis and intrusion detection modeling using UAV flight data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# UAV Intrusion Detection Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end statistical analysis and intrusion detection
model using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight data. The goal is to distinguish
between normal UAV behavior and potential intrusion or malicious activity using
supervised learning techniques.

The project was completed as a collaborative final project and uses GitHub
for version control and team-based development.

## Dataset
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Intrusion Detection Dataset (2020)  
UCI Machine Learning Repository  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C56P6X

The dataset contains UAV telemetry and communication-related features used to
identify intrusive or anomalous UAV activity.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess UAV telemetry data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate statistical and machine learning models for intrusion detection
- Assess model validity, assumptions, and limitations
